The high-performance core for the [Sunoh Music App](https://www.sunoh.online), delivering a unified music discovery experience by orchestrating data from multiple industry-leading providers.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Sunoh API is a modern, TypeScript-based middleware designed to bridge the gap between various music sources. It provides a homogeneous data structure, allowing client applications to interact with many providers through a single, consistent interface.

### **Key Features**
- 🌪️ **Unified Search & Home**: Intelligent result merging and interleaving from Saavn and Gaana.
- 📻 **Universal Radio**: Coordinated radio stations across providers with infinite playback support.
- ⚡ **Multi-Tier Caching**: Robust Redis-backed caching system with granular TTL policies.
- 🎼 **Provider-Agnostic Interface**: One API for Songs, Albums, Playlists, and Artists regardless of the source.
- 🎤 **LRC/Synced Lyrics**: High-quality sync lyrics integration via specialized providers.
- 🟢 **Gaana Integration Plus**: Native support for stream decryption, curated occasions, and radio stations.
- 🐋 **Docker Ready**: Fully containerized environment for seamless deployment and development.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js (v20+)
- **Framework**: [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) (High performance, low overhead)
- **Language**: TypeScript (Type-safe codebase)
- **Database/Cache**: Redis (High-speed data persistence)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Vercel Serverless and Standalone Docker.

## 🏛️ Architecture

### **Unified Search Engine**
The API implements a sophisticated merging algorithm that prioritizes data quality and relevancy. When a search is performed:
1. It queries multiple providers (Saavn, Gaana) in parallel using `Promise.allSettled`.
2. It deduplicates results based on internal IDs and normalized titles.
3. It cleans "dirty" metadata (e.g., placeholder titles like "Untitled" or "None").
4. It prioritizes the highest resolution imagery available (`atw` format).

### **Universal Radio Stations**
The API coordinates radio stations from Saavn and Gaana into a single stream. It supports creation of stations from artists or specific songs and provides a server-side cursor for endless music.

### **Data Homogenization**
All source data is mapped to a strictly typed internal schema before returning. This means your frontend doesn't need to know if a song came from Saavn or Gaana; it always receives the exact same JSON structure.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### **Environment Setup**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
PORT=3600
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
# PROVIDER TOKENS
LYRICS_TOKEN=your_token
MEDIA_USER_TOKEN=your_token
```

### **1. Using Docker (Recommended)**
The fastest way to get up and running:
```bash
# Start API and Redis containers
npm run docker:up -- --build
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:3600`.

### **2. Local Development**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

## 📖 API Documentation

Detailed endpoint specifications can be found in [api-endpoints.json](api-endpoints.json).

### **Core Endpoints**
| Path | Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/music/home` | `GET` | Unified home screen with interleaved charts and releases. |
| `/music/search` | `GET` | Merged search results for songs, albums, and playlists. |
| `/music/recommend` | `GET` | Get similar songs based on a search query (`q`). |
| `/music/radio` | `GET` | Browse featured radio stations from all providers. |
| `/music/artist/radio` | `GET` | Start an artist-based radio station via query (`q`). |
| `/music/song/:id` | `GET` | Full song metadata and streaming URLs. |
| `/music/occasions`| `GET` | Browse curated moods and genres (Gaana focused). |
| `/lyrics/:name` | `GET` | Get LRC/Synced lyrics for a specific track. |

## 📻 Universal Radio & Recommendations

The API provides a set of high-level endpoints to drive a "Discovery" experience.

### **1. Smart Recommendations**
Fetch a list of similar songs and a coordinated radio station using just a song name.
- **Endpoint**: `GET /music/recommend?q=Song Name`
- **Response**: Returns a `list` of songs and a `stationId`.

### **2. Artist Radio**
Start a personalized stream for any artist.
- **Endpoint**: `GET /music/artist/radio?q=Artist Name`
- **Response**: Returns a `stationId` and the first 20 tracks.

### **4. Universal Radio Wrapper (Unified)**
The API provides a seamless, provider-agnostic way to handle infinite radio playback.

**Step 1: Initialize Session**
Call this when the user clicks "Start Radio" on an entity.
- **Endpoint**: `GET /music/radio/session`
- **Params**:
  - `id`: Entity ID (Song/Artist ID)
  - `type`: `song` | `artist` | `featured`
  - `provider`: `saavn` | `gaana`
  - `name`: (Optional) Name for Featured/Artist stations
- **Response**: Returns a unified `stationId` (e.g., `saavn_PID123`, `gaana_12345`).

**Step 2: Fetch Songs / Infinite Playback**
Use the returned `stationId` to fetch songs. Supports pagination.
- **Endpoint**: `GET /music/radio/:stationId`
- **Params**:
  - `k`: Number of songs (default 20)
  - `next`: Page number (default 1)
- **Response**: Returns a list of standardized `Song` objects ready for playback.

### **Legacy Radio Endpoints (Optional)**
Direct access to specific provider radio logic is still available via:
- `/saavn/station/create`
- `/gaana/radio/:id`

## 💾 Caching Policy

We employ a tiered caching strategy to ensure minimal latency:
- **Playlists & Albums**: 2 Hours (Tailored for discoverability).
- **Home & Occasions**: 3 Hours (Optimized for performance).
- **Fast-Changing Data**: No cache (e.g., real-time streams).

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### **Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Production build and run
docker compose up -d --build
```

### **Vercel Serverless**
The API is pre-configured for Vercel. 
```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```
